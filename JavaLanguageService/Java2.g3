/*
 * This file is modified by Yang Jiang (yang.jiang.z@gmail.com), taken from the original
 * java grammar in www.antlr.org, with the goal to provide a standard ANTLR grammar 
 * for java, as well as an implementation to construct the same AST trees as javac does.  
 * 
 * The major changes of this version as compared to the original version include:
 * 1) Top level rules are changed to include all of their sub-components. 
 *    For example, the rule
 * 
 *      classOrInterfaceDeclaration
 *          :   classOrInterfaceModifiers (classDeclaration | interfaceDeclaration)
 *      ;
 *
 *    is changed to
 * 
 *      classOrInterfaceDeclaration
 *          :   classDeclaration | interfaceDeclaration
 *      ;
 *    
 *    with classOrInterfaceModifiers been moved inside classDeclaration and 
 *    interfaceDeclaration.
 * 
 * 2) The original version is not quite clear on certain rules like memberDecl, 
 *    where it mixed the styles of listing of top level rules and listing of sub rules.
 *
 *    memberDecl
 *      :   genericMethodOrConstructorDecl
 *      |   memberDeclaration
 *      |   'void' Identifier voidMethodDeclaratorRest   
 *      |   Identifier constructorDeclaratorRest
 *      |   interfaceDeclaration
 *      |   classDeclaration
 *      ;
 *
 *    This is changed to a 
 *
 *    memberDecl
 *      :   fieldDeclaration        
 *      |   methodDeclaration
 *      |   classDeclaration
 *      |   interfaceDeclaration
 *      ;
 *    by folding similar rules into single rule.
 *
 * 3) Some syntactical predicates are added for efficiency, although this is not necessary 
 *    for correctness.
 *
 * 4) Lexer part is rewritten completely to construct tokens needed for the parser.
 * 
 * 5) This grammar adds more source level support
 *
 *
 * This grammar also adds bug fixes.
 *
 * 1) Adding typeArguments to superSuffix to alHexSignificandlow input like 
 *      super.<TYPE>method()
 * 
 * 2) Adding typeArguments to innerCreator to allow input like 
 *      new Type1<String, Integer>().new Type2<String>()
 * 
 * 3) conditionalExpression is changed to 
 *    conditionalExpression
 *      :   conditionalOrExpression ( '?' expression ':' conditionalExpression )?
 *      ;
 *    to accept input like 
 *      true?1:2=3
 *    
 *    Note: note this is by no means a valid input, by the grammar should be able to parse 
 *    this as 
 *            (true?1:2)=3  
 *    rather than    
 *            true?1:(2=3)
 *
 *  
 *  Know problems:
 *    Won't pass input containing unicode sequence like this 
 *      char c = '\uffff'
 *      String s = "\uffff";
 *    Because Antlr does not treat '\uffff' as an valid char. This will be fixed in the next Antlr 
 *    release.
 * 
 *  Things to do:
 *    More effort to make this grammar faster.
 *    Error reporting/recovering.
 *  
 *  
 *  NOTE: If you try to compile this file from command line and Antlr gives an exception 
 *    like error message while compiling, add option 
 *    -Xconversiontimeout 100000
 *    to the command line.  
 *    If it still doesn't work or the compilation process
 *    takes too long, try to comment out the following two lines:
 *    |    {isValidSurrogateIdentifierStart((char)input.LT(1), (char)input.LT(2))}?=>('\ud800'..'\udbff') ('\udc00'..'\udfff')
 *    |    {isValidSurrogateIdentifierPart((char)input.LT(1), (char)input.LT(2))}?=>('\ud800'..'\udbff') ('\udc00'..'\udfff')
 *   
 *
 *  Below are comments found in the original version.

/** A Java 1.5 grammar for ANTLR v3 derived from the spec
 *
 *  This is a very close representation of the spec; the changes
 *  are comestic (remove left recursion) and also fixes (the spec
 *  isn't exactly perfect).  I have run this on the 1.4.2 source
 *  and some nasty looking enums from 1.5, but have not really
 *  tested for 1.5 compatibility.
 *
 *  I built this with: java -Xmx100M org.antlr.Tool java.g
 *  and got two errors that are ok (for now):
 *  java.g:691:9: Decision can match input such as
 *    "'0'..'9'{'E', 'e'}{'+', '-'}'0'..'9'{'D', 'F', 'd', 'f'}"
 *    using multiple alternatives: 3, 4
 *  As a result, alternative(s) 4 were disabled for that input
 *  java.g:734:35: Decision can match input such as "{'$', 'A'..'Z',
 *    '_', 'a'..'z', '\u00C0'..'\u00D6', '\u00D8'..'\u00F6',
 *    '\u00F8'..'\u1FFF', '\u3040'..'\u318F', '\u3300'..'\u337F',
 *    '\u3400'..'\u3D2D', '\u4E00'..'\u9FFF', '\uF900'..'\uFAFF'}"
 *    using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
 *  As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
 *
 *  You can turn enum on/off as a keyword :)
 *
 *  Version 1.0 -- initial release July 5, 2006 (requires 3.0b2 or higher)
 *
 *  Primary author: Terence Parr, July 2006
 *
 *  Version 1.0.1 -- corrections by Koen Vanderkimpen & Marko van Dooren,
 *      October 25, 2006;
 *      fixed normalInterfaceDeclaration: now uses typeParameters instead
 *          of typeParameter (according to JLS, 3rd edition)
 *      fixed castExpression: no longer allows expression next to type
 *          (according to semantics in JLS, in contrast with syntax in JLS)
 *
 *  Version 1.0.2 -- Terence Parr, Nov 27, 2006
 *      java spec I built this from had some bizarre for-loop control.
 *          Looked weird and so I looked elsewhere...Yep, it's messed up.
 *          simplified.
 *
 *  Version 1.0.3 -- Chris Hogue, Feb 26, 2007
 *      Factored out an annotationName rule and used it in the annotation rule.
 *          Not sure why, but typeName wasn't recognizing references to inner
 *          annotations (e.g. @InterfaceName.InnerAnnotation())
 *      Factored out the elementValue section of an annotation reference.  Created
 *          elementValuePair and elementValuePairs rules, then used them in the
 *          annotation rule.  Allows it to recognize annotation references with
 *          multiple, comma separated attributes.
 *      Updated elementValueArrayInitializer so that it allows multiple elements.
 *          (It was only allowing 0 or 1 element).
 *      Updated localVariableDeclaration to allow annotations.  Interestingly the JLS
 *          doesn't appear to indicate this is legal, but it does work as of at least
 *          JDK 1.5.0_06.
 *      Moved the Identifier portion of annotationTypeElementRest to annotationMethodRest.
 *          Because annotationConstantRest already references variableDeclarator which
 *          has the Identifier portion in it, the parser would fail on constants in
 *          annotation definitions because it expected two identifiers.
 *      Added optional trailing ';' to the alternatives in annotationTypeElementRest.
 *          Wouldn't handle an inner interface that has a trailing ';'.
 *      Swapped the expression and type rule reference order in castExpression to
 *          make it check for genericized casts first.  It was failing to recognize a
 *          statement like  "Class<Byte> TYPE = (Class<Byte>)...;" because it was seeing
 *          'Class<Byte' in the cast expression as a less than expression, then failing
 *          on the '>'.
 *      Changed createdName to use typeArguments instead of nonWildcardTypeArguments.
 *         
 *      Changed the 'this' alternative in primary to allow 'identifierSuffix' rather than
 *          just 'arguments'.  The case it couldn't handle was a call to an explicit
 *          generic method invocation (e.g. this.<E>doSomething()).  Using identifierSuffix
 *          may be overly aggressive--perhaps should create a more constrained thisSuffix rule?
 *
 *  Version 1.0.4 -- Hiroaki Nakamura, May 3, 2007
 *
 *  Fixed formalParameterDecls, localVariableDeclaration, forInit,
 *  and forVarControl to use variableModifier* not 'final'? (annotation)?
 *
 *  Version 1.0.5 -- Terence, June 21, 2007
 *  --a[i].foo didn't work. Fixed unaryExpression
 *
 *  Version 1.0.6 -- John Ridgway, March 17, 2008
 *      Made "assert" a switchable keyword like "enum".
 *      Fixed compilationUnit to disallow "annotation importDeclaration ...".
 *      Changed "Identifier ('.' Identifier)*" to "qualifiedName" in more
 *          places.
 *      Changed modifier* and/or variableModifier* to classOrInterfaceModifiers,
 *          modifiers or variableModifiers, as appropriate.
 *      Renamed "bound" to "typeBound" to better match language in the JLS.
 *      Added "memberDeclaration" which rewrites to methodDeclaration or
 *      fieldDeclaration and pulled type into memberDeclaration.  So we parse
 *          type and then move on to decide whether we're dealing with a field
 *          or a method.
 *      Modified "constructorDeclaration" to use "constructorBody" instead of
 *          "methodBody".  constructorBody starts with explicitConstructorInvocation,
 *          then goes on to blockStatement*.  Pulling explicitConstructorInvocation
 *          out of expressions allowed me to simplify "primary".
 *      Changed variableDeclarator to simplify it.
 *      Changed type to use classOrInterfaceType, thus simplifying it; of course
 *          I then had to add classOrInterfaceType, but it is used in several
 *          places.
 *      Fixed annotations, old version allowed "@X(y,z)", which is illegal.
 *      Added optional comma to end of "elementValueArrayInitializer"; as per JLS.
 *      Changed annotationTypeElementRest to use normalClassDeclaration and
 *          normalInterfaceDeclaration rather than classDeclaration and
 *          interfaceDeclaration, thus getting rid of a couple of grammar ambiguities.
 *      Split localVariableDeclaration into localVariableDeclarationStatement
 *          (includes the terminating semi-colon) and localVariableDeclaration.
 *          This allowed me to use localVariableDeclaration in "forInit" clauses,
 *           simplifying them.
 *      Changed switchBlockStatementGroup to use multiple labels.  This adds an
 *          ambiguity, but if one uses appropriately greedy parsing it yields the
 *           parse that is closest to the meaning of the switch statement.
 *      Renamed "forVarControl" to "enhancedForControl" -- JLS language.
 *      Added semantic predicates to test for shift operations rather than other
 *          things.  Thus, for instance, the string "< <" will never be treated
 *          as a left-shift operator.
 *      In "creator" we rule out "nonWildcardTypeArguments" on arrayCreation,
 *          which are illegal.
 *      Moved "nonWildcardTypeArguments into innerCreator.
 *      Removed 'super' superSuffix from explicitGenericInvocation, since that
 *          is only used in explicitConstructorInvocation at the beginning of a
 *           constructorBody.  (This is part of the simplification of expressions
 *           mentioned earlier.)
 *      Simplified primary (got rid of those things that are only used in
 *          explicitConstructorInvocation).
 *      Lexer -- removed "Exponent?" from FloatingPointLiteral choice 4, since it
 *          led to an ambiguity.
 *
 *      This grammar successfully parses every .java file in the JDK 1.5 source
 *          tree (excluding those whose file names include '-', which are not
 *          valid Java compilation units).
 *
 *  Known remaining problems:
 *      "Letter" and "JavaIDDigit" are wrong.  The actual specification of
 *      "Letter" should be "a character for which the method
 *      Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(int) returns true."  A "Java
 *      letter-or-digit is a character for which the method
 *      Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(int) returns true."
